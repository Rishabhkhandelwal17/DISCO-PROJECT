The code is written in a Jupyter notebook to make our own understanding and learning process a bit easier, and to allow formatting with markdown. 

The cells should preferably be run one cell at a time but can be run all at once also. However, if run all at once, and a crash message is displayed, then the output from any cell beneath the cell that displays the crash message, is garbage and is to be ignored.

When testing different input files, the file name and path must be changed in the code directly. 

The test case inputs are also included in the repository.
The output files ‘faculty course allotment 1’ and faculty course allotment 2’ which are created for the test case file ‘testdata_5’ are also included.

When testing different input files, the file name and path must be changed in the code directly. 

Demonstration under different test cases is shown in the video attached as a WEBM file.

The latex file containing the report is attached. 

Most of the methodology and thought process is explained in the report as well as comments and markdown in the code itself.
